Project: Landing Page - from The Odin Project curriculum

This project consists of recreating a landing page design provided in this lesson of the The Odin Project curriculum. This will be carried out with all of the skills covered in the curriculum so far, with a focus on using the flexbox model for the design layout.

By the end of the project, I will have a better grasp on using the flexbox model, along with all of its related properties and values, to create more modern, complex layouts and webpage designs. Additionally, this will be the first time that I create a full webpage that consists of having an actual design, all with building the HTML and CSS from scratch, and not just using the normal flow that comes with the HTML elements by default.
